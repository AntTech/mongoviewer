<h4>mongoviewer, an MongoDB Explorer developed by node.js/express ,angularjs,mongoskin,bootstrap</h4>

Currently NG-Mongo will:

 - Browse local MongoDB databases, collections, and documents
 - simple collection  query ,create,delete,update well be support later

### Requirements
mongoviewer is written in Javascript (not CoffeeScript) on top of AngularJS and, of course, requires MongoDB.

The web server is NodeJS, [so you'll want to have Node installed as well](http://nodejs.org). If you receive errors on first start, run `npm install` in the root of the site (from the command line) to install any modules that don't get loaded from the repo.

### Installation
Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/dengqiao/mongoviewer.git` into any directory and make sure that MongoDB and Node are installed on your machine. 'node app.js'  start server
